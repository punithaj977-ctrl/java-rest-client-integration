# java-rest-client-integration
Aim:
The explicit title in the README is java-rest-client-integration.
The stated goal is to create a client integration (likely a Java client) for a REST service and then enhance it.
Integrate a Java REST Client.
Add additional features and UI/UX improvements.
Perform API enhancements.
Implement performance and security checks.
Test and deploy the enhancements (mentioning Netlify, Vercel, or cloud platform).

Apparent Features:
Based on the file present in the repository, the project seems to include:

Client-Side Code:

client.java: A Java program that acts as the REST client.
index.html: An HTML file, suggesting a web-based user interface for the client or a front-end that interacts with the client/service.
Documentation/Media:
README.md: Provides an overview, aim, and description of the project.
Video Demos: The files Demo vedio Client Integration.mp4 and Demo vedio.mp4 indicate video demonstrations of the client/integration are included.

Technologies

The file names clearly point to the use of the following technologies:
Java: The core client application is written in Java (client.java).
REST (Representational State Transfer): Indicated by the project title java-rest-client-integration, meaning the Java code interacts with a RESTful API.
HTML: Used for the user interface/front-end component (index.html)
Deployment Platforms: The README explicitly mentions planned or potential deployment on Netlify, Vercel, or a general cloud platform.
Git/GitHub: The project is hosted on GitHub (evident from the interface).
Markdown: Used for the project documentation (README.md).
